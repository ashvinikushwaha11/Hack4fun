        <font style="font-size: larger"><h3>Dogs are our best friend for a reason. Humans and dogs have shared a special bond for centuries.
             These friendly pups help us reduce anxiety and tension and love us with all they have. While we give sweet and comforting hugs to 
             our pets, there are some poor pups who live on the streets and are often deprived of all the warmth and affection.<br><br>

            We sometimes feel anxious and sad for these helpless dogs on streets in rough weather conditions and with poor health issues.
            <br><br>
            Millions of stray dogs live on the streets in India. You canâ€™t help all of them, so you can just take care of the dogs in your 
            locality and treat them well. Try to find and reach out to an animal shelter in case they need medical help.
